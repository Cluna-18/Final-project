Snake game (Python programming final project)

  My project is a python made version of the well known snake game. You control the snake which starts off as a single block and have to mkae your way around the board
  eating up the green pellets. With each pellet eaten, your snake will grow by a single block. Be careful not to run into yourself or into the edges of the board
  or it will be game over. A little twist is that every once in a while, a special purple pellet will appear and will be visible for 7 seconds before disaapearing, If 
  you manage to eat it, it will be worth 3 points and grow your snake by 3 blocks. 
  
  Some modules I used were time, pygame, and random.
  
  In order to run the game, first install pygame into python. Then copy and paste the code into the IDE and run the game.
